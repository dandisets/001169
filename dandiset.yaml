description: The value of the environment determines animalsâ€™ motivational states
  and sets expectations for error-based learning. How are values computed? Reinforcement
  learning systems can store or cache values of states or actions that are learned
  from experience, or they can compute values using a model of the environment to
  simulate possible futures. These value computations have distinct trade-offs, and
  a central question is how neural systems decide which computations to use or whether/how
  to combine them. Here we show that rats use distinct value computations for sequential
  decisions within single trials. We used high-throughput training to collect statistically
  powerful datasets from 291 rats performing a temporal wagering task with hidden
  reward states. Rats adjusted how quickly they initiated trials and how long they
  waited for rewards across states, balancing effort and time costs against expected
  rewards. Statistical modeling revealed that animals computed the value of the environment
  differently when initiating trials versus when deciding how long to wait for rewards,
  even though these decisions were only seconds apart. Moreover, value estimates interacted
  via a dynamic learning rate. Our results reveal how distinct value computations
  interact on rapid timescales, and demonstrate the power of using high-throughput
  training to understand rich, cognitive behaviors.

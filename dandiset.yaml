description: In this study, we explore odor-evoked activity representation in the
  olfactory bulb (OB) and how odor responses enable odor discrimination. Contrary
  to some previously cited theories that suggest a sparse representation, we hypothesize
  a more dense representation during odor presentation. A key question is how odors
  are reliably encoded in OB activity patterns, and how these patterns contribute
  to early odor processing. To address this problem, we recorded population level
  odor responses from the mouse OB with mesoscale two photon calcium imaging and applied
  machine learning techniques to suggest a model in which sparse coding is largely
  sufficient for olfaction, but redundant information may make odor coding more robust
  across different variables.
